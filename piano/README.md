# My Piano

piano.py, when run, opens a window that simulates a two-octave piano C4 - C6

## Installation

Packages needed to run piano.py: tkinter/Tkinter, simpleaudio, time and \_thread.

In Python 2, it is called Tkinter, while in Python 3, it is called tkinter. I found the
version control code here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17843596/difference-between-tkinter-and-tkinter
